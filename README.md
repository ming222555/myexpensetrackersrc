# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

When page loads, it will hit error that says "The request was made but no response was received. Please check internet connection".\
This is due to backend api server / database not being available.\
To see webapp in action with backend available and running, please refer to [Running myexpensetracker webapp (Create React App) locally with docker compose](https://github.com/ming222555/myexpensetracker)

Alternatively, you may run the version of webapp that relies on browser's indexdb database instead of forementioned backend.
To run the version that relies on indexdb, please switch to the [branch indexdb_database](https://github.com/ming222555/myexpensetrackersrc/tree/indexdb_database)
